## Modules

[Arcane Marks & Careers](https://github.com/moo-man/Arcane-Marks-Careers-FVTT) - I've made a module out of my [homebrew supplement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uTy2r0EDMdcISFqqyxeIOSadtzz-OTAg/view) which can also serve as an example for others to build off of. It includes a compendium pack of all the careers as well as tables to roll for marks.
